I created mythepisode purely out of my interest for the show "The King of Queens".  I had seen most episodes numerous times and was curious if I had seen them all.  I was able to view episode information from numerous sites on the internet but it was difficult to determine what I had seen or recorded.  I thought it would be nice to integrate the information with Mythtv so that I could select a show like "The King of Queens" and determine what I have recorded, what I have scheduled to record, and how many episodes I have left to record.

Mythepisode is a Mythweb add-on that allows the user to select the desired country or countries and display a listing of all current and past TV series. The series are organized alphabetically on the main page and gives three views to choose from.

The main page allows the user to display all shows ever aired, currently running shows, or shows that have had episodes previously recorded. Each show has a link that will take you to the complete listing of each episode for the particular show that includes episode number, original airdate, subtitle, and summary.  The episode page lets you know if you have previously recorded the episode, have it scheduled to record, or have it imported into Mythvideo.  From the episode listing page you have the option to create a TVwish list that will schedule the episodes selected for recording when they become available in the mythtv scheduler.

There are a number of configuration options that are accessible through mythweb that allow you to set things like desired country, thumbnail size, episode match accuracy, match override, etc.  View the wiki installation instructions for complete details.

Episode information is provided by [TVRage.com](http://www.tvrage.com) and [TheTVDB.com](http://www.TheTVDB.com).  Both sites have provided mythepisode an API key that allows us to access the information we need.  Since these sites rely on the community to provide the data we use, they appreciate and encourage contributions to their sites.

My hopes are that by sharing this other developers will take interest and make improvements/additions.  Anyone interested in contributing would be greatly appreciated.  In addition to coding, contributions to installation instructions/configuration would be very helpful.  All contributions are welcome.  I have a list of contributors in the wiki.
